1,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticip film year mani peopl includ oppenheim larg deliv much great feel like love two three hour like hour fact stop ador entir thing know christoph nolan dunkirk click second watch mayb oppenheim need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhaust filmbut mani way cant deni except well made one look sound amaz youd expect feel though accur captur time period set contain amaz sound design one year best score far everi perform good great film belong cillian murphi feel like he lead actor beat stage talk earli award considerationth film best focus psycholog thriller featur famou histor figur one point even turn psycholog horror film there one sequenc involv speech that particularli terrifi also manag suspens moment even though stori commonli known histori pointi realli feel length final hour though mayb wish final act extend epilogu rather whole third movi current feel though wouldv love oppenheim hour instead noth bad mean littl patienc test subject rememb feel like similarli long babylon total justifi runtim though other didnt feel wayim left feel like watch film wasnt slam dunk incred runtim wasnt that still worth celebr make oppenheim worth see cinema sure,positive
2,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",youll wit brain fulli switch watch oppenheim could easili get away nonattent viewer intellig filmmak show audienc great respect fire dialogu pack inform relentless pace jump differ time oppenheim life continu hour runtim visual clue guid viewer time youll get grip quit quickli relentless help express urgenc u attack chase atom bomb germani could absolut career best perform consistenli brilliant cillian murphi anchor film nail oscar perform fact whole cast fantast apart mayb sometim overwrought emili blunt perform rdj also particularli brilliant return proper act decad call screenplay den layer id say thick bibl cinematographi quit stark spare part imbu rich luciou colour moment especi scene florenc pugh score beauti time mostli anxiou oppress ad relentless pace hour runtim fli found intens tax highli reward watch film make finest realli great watch,positive
3,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolan work realli look forward understood would flip timelin id need concentr didnt find problem storytel beauti done act univers excel saw review say emili blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im get old found direct quit jar jump cut galor keep thing move along apac rather exhaust also found music sound loud point intrus much like nolan film goe interstellar love also loud musical qualiti watch left long day call cerebr biopic littl tranquil,neutral
4,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

6,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

8,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

10,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive
11,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",cillian murphi except lead role oscar worthyil say he abli support terrif ensembl cast great see jame remar againth film pose mani moralist question bomb repercuss oppenheim film work best especi never seen moment drop japan sound nightmarish look peopl face horrifichowev hr tediou talki frankli rather boringth sound good visual didnt need made imaxit better tenet nice see mum dad,positive
12,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

13,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
14,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

15,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
16,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watch oppenheim great experi know mani peopl critic movi histor accuraci absenc think christoph nolan made complic man stori compel engag simpl understand actor phenomen apart main lead robert downey probabl done one finest work express time deliveri everyth par cinematographi craft beauti ador enjoy whole three hour ea delight first attempt christoph nolan biographi think expect work genr sinc entertain also spark interest know histori read book earlier went watch littl bit knowledg still enjoy film wish could tell cillian murphi person stun screen presenc throughout hope movi win award like deserv,positive
17,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christoph nolan probabl best blockbust director along ridley scott return good old fashion nocgi drama tension come word spoken peopl react chase shootout death defi stunt explos wait actual one explos dont know made scene without cgi technic achiev sureal shot mm imax beauti film lead cast season actor terrif jobmi gripe tad long final act couldshould trim still best movi seen yeari strongli recommend watch imax screen taken month,positive
18,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
19,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

21,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months.

22,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

23,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
24,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
25,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

26,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticip film year mani peopl includ oppenheim larg deliv much great feel like love two three hour like hour fact stop ador entir thing know christoph nolan dunkirk click second watch mayb oppenheim need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhaust filmbut mani way cant deni except well made one look sound amaz youd expect feel though accur captur time period set contain amaz sound design one year best score far everi perform good great film belong cillian murphi feel like he lead actor beat stage talk earli award considerationth film best focus psycholog thriller featur famou histor figur one point even turn psycholog horror film there one sequenc involv speech that particularli terrifi also manag suspens moment even though stori commonli known histori pointi realli feel length final hour though mayb wish final act extend epilogu rather whole third movi current feel though wouldv love oppenheim hour instead noth bad mean littl patienc test subject rememb feel like similarli long babylon total justifi runtim though other didnt feel wayim left feel like watch film wasnt slam dunk incred runtim wasnt that still worth celebr make oppenheim worth see cinema sure,positive
27,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

29,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

33,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine .

35,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

37,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

38,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
39,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

40,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
41,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

42,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

43,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
44,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

46,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months.

47,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

48,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
49,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
50,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view.

51,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

52,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

54,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

56,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

58,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

60,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

62,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

63,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code.

64,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day. I'm endlessly sad that I have to wait another three years for a new Nolan movie, and hope that he switches back to something more intriguing than the life of a scientist.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/20/2023)",christoph nolan favorit director time four top six movi eight top twenti absurd much joy he given consid full extent word geniuslet start say object good movi technic aspect nolan standard act fantast ridicul cast one stood alway amaz emili blunt soontob oscar winner hope downi jrsubject hate say found bore long think movi long need hate studio mess art achiev shorter runtim reason bore fairli uninterest invest evok emot someth nolan normal better anyon even check time one point someth never imagin id say nolan moviewhil still treat see imax expand aspect ratio isnt anyth wow asid one scene part love nolan movi feel awe wit someth screen ive never seen could possibl imagin case herethi isnt critic music score realli good work movi im beg nolan reunit han zimmer one level music score incept interstellar dark knight trilog icon stuck head way home add playlist listen repeatedli even decad later everyon recogn music movi even havent seen year case herei want emphas subject opinion dont normal go historicalbiograph movi part reason scifi favorit genr limitless possibl movi base realiti much limit still realli creativ fiction like memento follow biograph film real event extrem limit lack beauti unknown dunkirk least made amaz action scenesif enjoy histor movi probabl love like everyon el felt like realli wellmad movi wed watch histori class movi day im endlessli sad wait anoth three year new nolan movi hope switch back someth intrigu life scientist view open thursday imax,neutral
65,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
66,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

67,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christoph nolan probabl best blockbust director along ridley scott return good old fashion nocgi drama tension come word spoken peopl react chase shootout death defi stunt explos wait actual one explos dont know made scene without cgi technic achiev sureal shot mm imax beauti film lead cast season actor terrif jobmi gripe tad long final act couldshould trim still best movi seen yeari strongli recommend watch imax screen taken month,positive
68,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
69,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

71,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months.

72,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

73,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
74,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
75,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here.

76,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticip film year mani peopl includ oppenheim larg deliv much great feel like love two three hour like hour fact stop ador entir thing know christoph nolan dunkirk click second watch mayb oppenheim need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhaust filmbut mani way cant deni except well made one look sound amaz youd expect feel though accur captur time period set contain amaz sound design one year best score far everi perform good great film belong cillian murphi feel like he lead actor beat stage talk earli award considerationth film best focus psycholog thriller featur famou histor figur one point even turn psycholog horror film there one sequenc involv speech that particularli terrifi also manag suspens moment even though stori commonli known histori pointi realli feel length final hour though mayb wish final act extend epilogu rather whole third movi current feel though wouldv love oppenheim hour instead noth bad mean littl patienc test subject rememb feel like similarli long babylon total justifi runtim though other didnt feel wayim left feel like watch film wasnt slam dunk incred runtim wasnt that still worth celebr make oppenheim worth see cinema sure,positive
77,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

78,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

79,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

81,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

85,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive
86,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",cillian murphi except lead role oscar worthyil say he abli support terrif ensembl cast great see jame remar againth film pose mani moralist question bomb repercuss oppenheim film work best especi never seen moment drop japan sound nightmarish look peopl face horrifichowev hr tediou talki frankli rather boringth sound good visual didnt need made imaxit better tenet nice see mum dad,positive
87,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

88,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
89,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

90,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
91,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watch oppenheim great experi know mani peopl critic movi histor accuraci absenc think christoph nolan made complic man stori compel engag simpl understand actor phenomen apart main lead robert downey probabl done one finest work express time deliveri everyth par cinematographi craft beauti ador enjoy whole three hour ea delight first attempt christoph nolan biographi think expect work genr sinc entertain also spark interest know histori read book earlier went watch littl bit knowledg still enjoy film wish could tell cillian murphi person stun screen presenc throughout hope movi win award like deserv,positive
92,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christoph nolan probabl best blockbust director along ridley scott return good old fashion nocgi drama tension come word spoken peopl react chase shootout death defi stunt explos wait actual one explos dont know made scene without cgi technic achiev sureal shot mm imax beauti film lead cast season actor terrif jobmi gripe tad long final act couldshould trim still best movi seen yeari strongli recommend watch imax screen taken month,positive
93,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
94,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months.

97,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

98,"My Review - Oppenheimer

In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
99,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
100,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due. A 10 used to meant perfection, not just the glare or the sparkles.

101,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticip film year mani peopl includ oppenheim larg deliv much great feel like love two three hour like hour fact stop ador entir thing know christoph nolan dunkirk click second watch mayb oppenheim need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhaust filmbut mani way cant deni except well made one look sound amaz youd expect feel though accur captur time period set contain amaz sound design one year best score far everi perform good great film belong cillian murphi feel like he lead actor beat stage talk earli award considerationth film best focus psycholog thriller featur famou histor figur one point even turn psycholog horror film there one sequenc involv speech that particularli terrifi also manag suspens moment even though stori commonli known histori pointi realli feel length final hour though mayb wish final act extend epilogu rather whole third movi current feel though wouldv love oppenheim hour instead noth bad mean littl patienc test subject rememb feel like similarli long babylon total justifi runtim though other didnt feel wayim left feel like watch film wasnt slam dunk incred runtim wasnt that still worth celebr make oppenheim worth see cinema sure,positive
102,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

103,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

104,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

105,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking!

106,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

108,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

110,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

112,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

113,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
114,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

115,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
116,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watch oppenheim great experi know mani peopl critic movi histor accuraci absenc think christoph nolan made complic man stori compel engag simpl understand actor phenomen apart main lead robert downey probabl done one finest work express time deliveri everyth par cinematographi craft beauti ador enjoy whole three hour ea delight first attempt christoph nolan biographi think expect work genr sinc entertain also spark interest know histori read book earlier went watch littl bit knowledg still enjoy film wish could tell cillian murphi person stun screen presenc throughout hope movi win award like deserv,positive

118,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
119,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

122,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

123,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
124,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
125,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming.

126,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

127,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

129,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

131,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

133,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

135,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

137,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

138,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
139,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

140,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
141,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watch oppenheim great experi know mani peopl critic movi histor accuraci absenc think christoph nolan made complic man stori compel engag simpl understand actor phenomen apart main lead robert downey probabl done one finest work express time deliveri everyth par cinematographi craft beauti ador enjoy whole three hour ea delight first attempt christoph nolan biographi think expect work genr sinc entertain also spark interest know histori read book earlier went watch littl bit knowledg still enjoy film wish could tell cillian murphi person stun screen presenc throughout hope movi win award like deserv,positive
142,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

143,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
144,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

147,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

148,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
149,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
150,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

151,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

152,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

153,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

154,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

156,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

160,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

162,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

163,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
164,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

165,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
166,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

167,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

168,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
169,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

171,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months.

172,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

173,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
174,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
175,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view.

176,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

177,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting.

179,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

180,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

181,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

183,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

185,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

187,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

188,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
189,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

190,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

191,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

192,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christoph nolan probabl best blockbust director along ridley scott return good old fashion nocgi drama tension come word spoken peopl react chase shootout death defi stunt explos wait actual one explos dont know made scene without cgi technic achiev sureal shot mm imax beauti film lead cast season actor terrif jobmi gripe tad long final act couldshould trim still best movi seen yeari strongli recommend watch imax screen taken month,positive
193,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
194,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

197,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

198,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
199,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
200,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here.

201,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

202,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

203,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting.

204,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest!

Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

206,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

208,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

210,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

212,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

213,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
214,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

215,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
216,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

217,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

218,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
219,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

222,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

223,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
224,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
225,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

226,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

227,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

229,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

231,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

235,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

237,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

238,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
239,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

240,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
241,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

242,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

243,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
244,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

245,"Authentic audio-visual journey to the era of the birth of atomic genesis, which both terrifies and astonishes you with its nonlinear storytelling thanks to Christopher Nolan's masterful approach to direction and screenplay!

246,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months.

247,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

248,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
249,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
250,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view.

251,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

252,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

254,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

255,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

256,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

258,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

260,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

262,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

263,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
264,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

265,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
266,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

267,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christoph nolan probabl best blockbust director along ridley scott return good old fashion nocgi drama tension come word spoken peopl react chase shootout death defi stunt explos wait actual one explos dont know made scene without cgi technic achiev sureal shot mm imax beauti film lead cast season actor terrif jobmi gripe tad long final act couldshould trim still best movi seen yeari strongli recommend watch imax screen taken month,positive
268,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
269,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

271,"It's isn't a masterpiece.

272,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

273,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
274,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
275,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view.

276,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticip film year mani peopl includ oppenheim larg deliv much great feel like love two three hour like hour fact stop ador entir thing know christoph nolan dunkirk click second watch mayb oppenheim need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhaust filmbut mani way cant deni except well made one look sound amaz youd expect feel though accur captur time period set contain amaz sound design one year best score far everi perform good great film belong cillian murphi feel like he lead actor beat stage talk earli award considerationth film best focus psycholog thriller featur famou histor figur one point even turn psycholog horror film there one sequenc involv speech that particularli terrifi also manag suspens moment even though stori commonli known histori pointi realli feel length final hour though mayb wish final act extend epilogu rather whole third movi current feel though wouldv love oppenheim hour instead noth bad mean littl patienc test subject rememb feel like similarli long babylon total justifi runtim though other didnt feel wayim left feel like watch film wasnt slam dunk incred runtim wasnt that still worth celebr make oppenheim worth see cinema sure,positive
277,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

278,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolan work realli look forward understood would flip timelin id need concentr didnt find problem storytel beauti done act univers excel saw review say emili blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im get old found direct quit jar jump cut galor keep thing move along apac rather exhaust also found music sound loud point intrus much like nolan film goe interstellar love also loud musical qualiti watch left long day call cerebr biopic littl tranquil,neutral
279,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

281,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

285,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

287,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

288,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
289,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

290,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
291,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watch oppenheim great experi know mani peopl critic movi histor accuraci absenc think christoph nolan made complic man stori compel engag simpl understand actor phenomen apart main lead robert downey probabl done one finest work express time deliveri everyth par cinematographi craft beauti ador enjoy whole three hour ea delight first attempt christoph nolan biographi think expect work genr sinc entertain also spark interest know histori read book earlier went watch littl bit knowledg still enjoy film wish could tell cillian murphi person stun screen presenc throughout hope movi win award like deserv,positive
292,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christoph nolan probabl best blockbust director along ridley scott return good old fashion nocgi drama tension come word spoken peopl react chase shootout death defi stunt explos wait actual one explos dont know made scene without cgi technic achiev sureal shot mm imax beauti film lead cast season actor terrif jobmi gripe tad long final act couldshould trim still best movi seen yeari strongli recommend watch imax screen taken month,positive
293,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
294,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

297,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

298,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
299,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
300,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

301,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

302,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

304,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

308,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

310,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

312,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

313,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
314,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

315,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
316,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watch oppenheim great experi know mani peopl critic movi histor accuraci absenc think christoph nolan made complic man stori compel engag simpl understand actor phenomen apart main lead robert downey probabl done one finest work express time deliveri everyth par cinematographi craft beauti ador enjoy whole three hour ea delight first attempt christoph nolan biographi think expect work genr sinc entertain also spark interest know histori read book earlier went watch littl bit knowledg still enjoy film wish could tell cillian murphi person stun screen presenc throughout hope movi win award like deserv,positive
317,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them.

I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

318,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
319,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

322,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

323,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
324,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
325,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming.

326,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

327,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

329,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

331,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

333,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

335,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

338,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
339,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

340,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
341,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

342,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

343,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
344,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

347,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

348,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
349,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
350,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction.

351,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticip film year mani peopl includ oppenheim larg deliv much great feel like love two three hour like hour fact stop ador entir thing know christoph nolan dunkirk click second watch mayb oppenheim need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhaust filmbut mani way cant deni except well made one look sound amaz youd expect feel though accur captur time period set contain amaz sound design one year best score far everi perform good great film belong cillian murphi feel like he lead actor beat stage talk earli award considerationth film best focus psycholog thriller featur famou histor figur one point even turn psycholog horror film there one sequenc involv speech that particularli terrifi also manag suspens moment even though stori commonli known histori pointi realli feel length final hour though mayb wish final act extend epilogu rather whole third movi current feel though wouldv love oppenheim hour instead noth bad mean littl patienc test subject rememb feel like similarli long babylon total justifi runtim though other didnt feel wayim left feel like watch film wasnt slam dunk incred runtim wasnt that still worth celebr make oppenheim worth see cinema sure,positive
352,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

353,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

354,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

356,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

360,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

362,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

363,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
364,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

365,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
366,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watch oppenheim great experi know mani peopl critic movi histor accuraci absenc think christoph nolan made complic man stori compel engag simpl understand actor phenomen apart main lead robert downey probabl done one finest work express time deliveri everyth par cinematographi craft beauti ador enjoy whole three hour ea delight first attempt christoph nolan biographi think expect work genr sinc entertain also spark interest know histori read book earlier went watch littl bit knowledg still enjoy film wish could tell cillian murphi person stun screen presenc throughout hope movi win award like deserv,positive
367,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

368,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
369,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

372,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

373,"My Review - Oppenheimer

In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
374,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
375,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

376,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticip film year mani peopl includ oppenheim larg deliv much great feel like love two three hour like hour fact stop ador entir thing know christoph nolan dunkirk click second watch mayb oppenheim need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhaust filmbut mani way cant deni except well made one look sound amaz youd expect feel though accur captur time period set contain amaz sound design one year best score far everi perform good great film belong cillian murphi feel like he lead actor beat stage talk earli award considerationth film best focus psycholog thriller featur famou histor figur one point even turn psycholog horror film there one sequenc involv speech that particularli terrifi also manag suspens moment even though stori commonli known histori pointi realli feel length final hour though mayb wish final act extend epilogu rather whole third movi current feel though wouldv love oppenheim hour instead noth bad mean littl patienc test subject rememb feel like similarli long babylon total justifi runtim though other didnt feel wayim left feel like watch film wasnt slam dunk incred runtim wasnt that still worth celebr make oppenheim worth see cinema sure,positive
377,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

378,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

379,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

380,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking!

381,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

383,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

385,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

388,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
389,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

390,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
391,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watch oppenheim great experi know mani peopl critic movi histor accuraci absenc think christoph nolan made complic man stori compel engag simpl understand actor phenomen apart main lead robert downey probabl done one finest work express time deliveri everyth par cinematographi craft beauti ador enjoy whole three hour ea delight first attempt christoph nolan biographi think expect work genr sinc entertain also spark interest know histori read book earlier went watch littl bit knowledg still enjoy film wish could tell cillian murphi person stun screen presenc throughout hope movi win award like deserv,positive

393,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
394,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

397,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

398,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
399,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
400,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming.

401,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

402,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

404,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest!

Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

406,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

408,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

410,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

412,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

413,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
414,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

415,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
416,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

417,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

418,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
419,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

422,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

423,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
424,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
425,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

426,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

427,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

429,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

431,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

435,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

437,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

438,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
439,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

440,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
441,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

442,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

443,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
444,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

446,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months.

447,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

448,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
449,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
450,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here.

451,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

452,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting.

454,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

455,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

456,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

458,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

460,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

462,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

463,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
464,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

465,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

466,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

467,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

468,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
469,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

472,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

473,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
474,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
475,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming.

476,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

477,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

478,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting.

479,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

481,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

485,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

487,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

488,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
489,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

490,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
491,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

492,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

493,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
494,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

497,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

498,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
499,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
500,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

501,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

502,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

504,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

506,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

510,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

512,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

513,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
514,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

515,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
516,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

517,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

518,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
519,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

520,"Authentic audio-visual journey to the era of the birth of atomic genesis, which both terrifies and astonishes you with its nonlinear storytelling thanks to Christopher Nolan's masterful approach to direction and screenplay!

521,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months.

522,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

523,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
524,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
525,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction.

526,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

527,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

529,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

530,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

531,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

533,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

535,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

537,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

538,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
539,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

540,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
541,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watch oppenheim great experi know mani peopl critic movi histor accuraci absenc think christoph nolan made complic man stori compel engag simpl understand actor phenomen apart main lead robert downey probabl done one finest work express time deliveri everyth par cinematographi craft beauti ador enjoy whole three hour ea delight first attempt christoph nolan biographi think expect work genr sinc entertain also spark interest know histori read book earlier went watch littl bit knowledg still enjoy film wish could tell cillian murphi person stun screen presenc throughout hope movi win award like deserv,positive
542,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christoph nolan probabl best blockbust director along ridley scott return good old fashion nocgi drama tension come word spoken peopl react chase shootout death defi stunt explos wait actual one explos dont know made scene without cgi technic achiev sureal shot mm imax beauti film lead cast season actor terrif jobmi gripe tad long final act couldshould trim still best movi seen yeari strongli recommend watch imax screen taken month,positive
543,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
544,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

546,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months.

547,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

548,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
549,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
550,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view.

551,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticip film year mani peopl includ oppenheim larg deliv much great feel like love two three hour like hour fact stop ador entir thing know christoph nolan dunkirk click second watch mayb oppenheim need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhaust filmbut mani way cant deni except well made one look sound amaz youd expect feel though accur captur time period set contain amaz sound design one year best score far everi perform good great film belong cillian murphi feel like he lead actor beat stage talk earli award considerationth film best focus psycholog thriller featur famou histor figur one point even turn psycholog horror film there one sequenc involv speech that particularli terrifi also manag suspens moment even though stori commonli known histori pointi realli feel length final hour though mayb wish final act extend epilogu rather whole third movi current feel though wouldv love oppenheim hour instead noth bad mean littl patienc test subject rememb feel like similarli long babylon total justifi runtim though other didnt feel wayim left feel like watch film wasnt slam dunk incred runtim wasnt that still worth celebr make oppenheim worth see cinema sure,positive
552,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

553,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolan work realli look forward understood would flip timelin id need concentr didnt find problem storytel beauti done act univers excel saw review say emili blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im get old found direct quit jar jump cut galor keep thing move along apac rather exhaust also found music sound loud point intrus much like nolan film goe interstellar love also loud musical qualiti watch left long day call cerebr biopic littl tranquil,neutral
554,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

556,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

560,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

562,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

563,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
564,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

565,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
566,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watch oppenheim great experi know mani peopl critic movi histor accuraci absenc think christoph nolan made complic man stori compel engag simpl understand actor phenomen apart main lead robert downey probabl done one finest work express time deliveri everyth par cinematographi craft beauti ador enjoy whole three hour ea delight first attempt christoph nolan biographi think expect work genr sinc entertain also spark interest know histori read book earlier went watch littl bit knowledg still enjoy film wish could tell cillian murphi person stun screen presenc throughout hope movi win award like deserv,positive
567,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christoph nolan probabl best blockbust director along ridley scott return good old fashion nocgi drama tension come word spoken peopl react chase shootout death defi stunt explos wait actual one explos dont know made scene without cgi technic achiev sureal shot mm imax beauti film lead cast season actor terrif jobmi gripe tad long final act couldshould trim still best movi seen yeari strongli recommend watch imax screen taken month,positive
568,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
569,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

572,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

573,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
574,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
575,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

576,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

577,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

579,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

583,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

585,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

587,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

588,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
589,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

590,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
591,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

593,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
594,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

597,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

598,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
599,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
600,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming.

601,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

602,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

604,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest!

Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

606,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

608,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

610,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

612,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

613,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
614,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

615,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
616,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

617,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

618,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
619,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

622,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

623,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
624,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
625,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction.

626,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticip film year mani peopl includ oppenheim larg deliv much great feel like love two three hour like hour fact stop ador entir thing know christoph nolan dunkirk click second watch mayb oppenheim need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhaust filmbut mani way cant deni except well made one look sound amaz youd expect feel though accur captur time period set contain amaz sound design one year best score far everi perform good great film belong cillian murphi feel like he lead actor beat stage talk earli award considerationth film best focus psycholog thriller featur famou histor figur one point even turn psycholog horror film there one sequenc involv speech that particularli terrifi also manag suspens moment even though stori commonli known histori pointi realli feel length final hour though mayb wish final act extend epilogu rather whole third movi current feel though wouldv love oppenheim hour instead noth bad mean littl patienc test subject rememb feel like similarli long babylon total justifi runtim though other didnt feel wayim left feel like watch film wasnt slam dunk incred runtim wasnt that still worth celebr make oppenheim worth see cinema sure,positive
627,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

628,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

629,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

631,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

635,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

637,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

638,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
639,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

640,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
641,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watch oppenheim great experi know mani peopl critic movi histor accuraci absenc think christoph nolan made complic man stori compel engag simpl understand actor phenomen apart main lead robert downey probabl done one finest work express time deliveri everyth par cinematographi craft beauti ador enjoy whole three hour ea delight first attempt christoph nolan biographi think expect work genr sinc entertain also spark interest know histori read book earlier went watch littl bit knowledg still enjoy film wish could tell cillian murphi person stun screen presenc throughout hope movi win award like deserv,positive
642,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

643,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
644,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

647,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

648,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
649,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
650,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

651,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticip film year mani peopl includ oppenheim larg deliv much great feel like love two three hour like hour fact stop ador entir thing know christoph nolan dunkirk click second watch mayb oppenheim need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhaust filmbut mani way cant deni except well made one look sound amaz youd expect feel though accur captur time period set contain amaz sound design one year best score far everi perform good great film belong cillian murphi feel like he lead actor beat stage talk earli award considerationth film best focus psycholog thriller featur famou histor figur one point even turn psycholog horror film there one sequenc involv speech that particularli terrifi also manag suspens moment even though stori commonli known histori pointi realli feel length final hour though mayb wish final act extend epilogu rather whole third movi current feel though wouldv love oppenheim hour instead noth bad mean littl patienc test subject rememb feel like similarli long babylon total justifi runtim though other didnt feel wayim left feel like watch film wasnt slam dunk incred runtim wasnt that still worth celebr make oppenheim worth see cinema sure,positive
652,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

653,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

654,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

655,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking!

656,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

658,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

660,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

663,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
664,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

665,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
666,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watch oppenheim great experi know mani peopl critic movi histor accuraci absenc think christoph nolan made complic man stori compel engag simpl understand actor phenomen apart main lead robert downey probabl done one finest work express time deliveri everyth par cinematographi craft beauti ador enjoy whole three hour ea delight first attempt christoph nolan biographi think expect work genr sinc entertain also spark interest know histori read book earlier went watch littl bit knowledg still enjoy film wish could tell cillian murphi person stun screen presenc throughout hope movi win award like deserv,positive

668,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
669,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

672,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

673,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
674,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
675,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming.

676,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

677,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

679,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest!

Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

681,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

683,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

685,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

687,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

688,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
689,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

690,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
691,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watch oppenheim great experi know mani peopl critic movi histor accuraci absenc think christoph nolan made complic man stori compel engag simpl understand actor phenomen apart main lead robert downey probabl done one finest work express time deliveri everyth par cinematographi craft beauti ador enjoy whole three hour ea delight first attempt christoph nolan biographi think expect work genr sinc entertain also spark interest know histori read book earlier went watch littl bit knowledg still enjoy film wish could tell cillian murphi person stun screen presenc throughout hope movi win award like deserv,positive
692,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christoph nolan probabl best blockbust director along ridley scott return good old fashion nocgi drama tension come word spoken peopl react chase shootout death defi stunt explos wait actual one explos dont know made scene without cgi technic achiev sureal shot mm imax beauti film lead cast season actor terrif jobmi gripe tad long final act couldshould trim still best movi seen yeari strongli recommend watch imax screen taken month,positive
693,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
694,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

697,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

698,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
699,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
700,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

701,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

702,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

703,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

704,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

706,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

710,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

712,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

713,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
714,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

715,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
716,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

717,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

718,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
719,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

722,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

723,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
724,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
725,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view.

726,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

727,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting.

729,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

730,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

731,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

733,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

735,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

738,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
739,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

740,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

741,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

742,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

743,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
744,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

747,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

748,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
749,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
750,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view.

751,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

752,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

753,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting.

754,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

756,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

760,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

762,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

763,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
764,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

765,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
766,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

767,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

768,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
769,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

772,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

773,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
774,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
775,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here.

776,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

777,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

779,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

781,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

785,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

787,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

788,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
789,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

790,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
791,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

792,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

793,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
794,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

795,"Authentic audio-visual journey to the era of the birth of atomic genesis, which both terrifies and astonishes you with its nonlinear storytelling thanks to Christopher Nolan's masterful approach to direction and screenplay!

796,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months.

797,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

798,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
799,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
800,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view.

801,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

802,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

804,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

805,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

806,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

808,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

810,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

812,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

813,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
814,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

815,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
816,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

817,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christoph nolan probabl best blockbust director along ridley scott return good old fashion nocgi drama tension come word spoken peopl react chase shootout death defi stunt explos wait actual one explos dont know made scene without cgi technic achiev sureal shot mm imax beauti film lead cast season actor terrif jobmi gripe tad long final act couldshould trim still best movi seen yeari strongli recommend watch imax screen taken month,positive
818,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
819,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

821,"It's isn't a masterpiece.

822,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

823,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
824,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
825,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming.

826,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticip film year mani peopl includ oppenheim larg deliv much great feel like love two three hour like hour fact stop ador entir thing know christoph nolan dunkirk click second watch mayb oppenheim need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhaust filmbut mani way cant deni except well made one look sound amaz youd expect feel though accur captur time period set contain amaz sound design one year best score far everi perform good great film belong cillian murphi feel like he lead actor beat stage talk earli award considerationth film best focus psycholog thriller featur famou histor figur one point even turn psycholog horror film there one sequenc involv speech that particularli terrifi also manag suspens moment even though stori commonli known histori pointi realli feel length final hour though mayb wish final act extend epilogu rather whole third movi current feel though wouldv love oppenheim hour instead noth bad mean littl patienc test subject rememb feel like similarli long babylon total justifi runtim though other didnt feel wayim left feel like watch film wasnt slam dunk incred runtim wasnt that still worth celebr make oppenheim worth see cinema sure,positive
827,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

828,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolan work realli look forward understood would flip timelin id need concentr didnt find problem storytel beauti done act univers excel saw review say emili blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im get old found direct quit jar jump cut galor keep thing move along apac rather exhaust also found music sound loud point intrus much like nolan film goe interstellar love also loud musical qualiti watch left long day call cerebr biopic littl tranquil,neutral
829,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

831,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

835,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

837,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

838,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
839,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

840,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
841,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watch oppenheim great experi know mani peopl critic movi histor accuraci absenc think christoph nolan made complic man stori compel engag simpl understand actor phenomen apart main lead robert downey probabl done one finest work express time deliveri everyth par cinematographi craft beauti ador enjoy whole three hour ea delight first attempt christoph nolan biographi think expect work genr sinc entertain also spark interest know histori read book earlier went watch littl bit knowledg still enjoy film wish could tell cillian murphi person stun screen presenc throughout hope movi win award like deserv,positive
842,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christoph nolan probabl best blockbust director along ridley scott return good old fashion nocgi drama tension come word spoken peopl react chase shootout death defi stunt explos wait actual one explos dont know made scene without cgi technic achiev sureal shot mm imax beauti film lead cast season actor terrif jobmi gripe tad long final act couldshould trim still best movi seen yeari strongli recommend watch imax screen taken month,positive
843,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
844,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

847,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

848,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
849,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
850,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here.

851,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

852,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

854,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

858,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

860,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

863,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
864,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

865,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
866,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

868,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
869,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

872,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

873,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
874,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
875,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming.

876,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

877,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

879,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

881,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

883,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

885,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

888,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
889,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

890,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
891,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

892,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christoph nolan probabl best blockbust director along ridley scott return good old fashion nocgi drama tension come word spoken peopl react chase shootout death defi stunt explos wait actual one explos dont know made scene without cgi technic achiev sureal shot mm imax beauti film lead cast season actor terrif jobmi gripe tad long final act couldshould trim still best movi seen yeari strongli recommend watch imax screen taken month,positive
893,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
894,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

897,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

898,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
899,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
900,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction.

901,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticip film year mani peopl includ oppenheim larg deliv much great feel like love two three hour like hour fact stop ador entir thing know christoph nolan dunkirk click second watch mayb oppenheim need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhaust filmbut mani way cant deni except well made one look sound amaz youd expect feel though accur captur time period set contain amaz sound design one year best score far everi perform good great film belong cillian murphi feel like he lead actor beat stage talk earli award considerationth film best focus psycholog thriller featur famou histor figur one point even turn psycholog horror film there one sequenc involv speech that particularli terrifi also manag suspens moment even though stori commonli known histori pointi realli feel length final hour though mayb wish final act extend epilogu rather whole third movi current feel though wouldv love oppenheim hour instead noth bad mean littl patienc test subject rememb feel like similarli long babylon total justifi runtim though other didnt feel wayim left feel like watch film wasnt slam dunk incred runtim wasnt that still worth celebr make oppenheim worth see cinema sure,positive
902,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

903,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

904,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

906,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

910,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

912,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

913,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
914,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

915,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
916,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watch oppenheim great experi know mani peopl critic movi histor accuraci absenc think christoph nolan made complic man stori compel engag simpl understand actor phenomen apart main lead robert downey probabl done one finest work express time deliveri everyth par cinematographi craft beauti ador enjoy whole three hour ea delight first attempt christoph nolan biographi think expect work genr sinc entertain also spark interest know histori read book earlier went watch littl bit knowledg still enjoy film wish could tell cillian murphi person stun screen presenc throughout hope movi win award like deserv,positive
917,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christoph nolan probabl best blockbust director along ridley scott return good old fashion nocgi drama tension come word spoken peopl react chase shootout death defi stunt explos wait actual one explos dont know made scene without cgi technic achiev sureal shot mm imax beauti film lead cast season actor terrif jobmi gripe tad long final act couldshould trim still best movi seen yeari strongli recommend watch imax screen taken month,positive
918,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
919,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

922,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

923,"My Review - Oppenheimer

In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
924,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
925,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

926,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticip film year mani peopl includ oppenheim larg deliv much great feel like love two three hour like hour fact stop ador entir thing know christoph nolan dunkirk click second watch mayb oppenheim need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhaust filmbut mani way cant deni except well made one look sound amaz youd expect feel though accur captur time period set contain amaz sound design one year best score far everi perform good great film belong cillian murphi feel like he lead actor beat stage talk earli award considerationth film best focus psycholog thriller featur famou histor figur one point even turn psycholog horror film there one sequenc involv speech that particularli terrifi also manag suspens moment even though stori commonli known histori pointi realli feel length final hour though mayb wish final act extend epilogu rather whole third movi current feel though wouldv love oppenheim hour instead noth bad mean littl patienc test subject rememb feel like similarli long babylon total justifi runtim though other didnt feel wayim left feel like watch film wasnt slam dunk incred runtim wasnt that still worth celebr make oppenheim worth see cinema sure,positive
927,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

928,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

929,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

930,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking!

931,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

933,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

935,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

937,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

938,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
939,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

940,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
941,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watch oppenheim great experi know mani peopl critic movi histor accuraci absenc think christoph nolan made complic man stori compel engag simpl understand actor phenomen apart main lead robert downey probabl done one finest work express time deliveri everyth par cinematographi craft beauti ador enjoy whole three hour ea delight first attempt christoph nolan biographi think expect work genr sinc entertain also spark interest know histori read book earlier went watch littl bit knowledg still enjoy film wish could tell cillian murphi person stun screen presenc throughout hope movi win award like deserv,positive

943,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
944,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

947,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

948,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
949,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
950,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming.

951,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

952,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

954,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

956,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

958,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collect thought experienc film cillian murphi might well start clear space mantl best actor oscarthi film masterclass weav narr differ time period explor profound depth man whose action alter world trajectori forev better wors nolan bring u complex oppenheim moral conflict stir within himmurphi portray rivet long runtim becam afterthought robert downey jr also offer great perform nolan push pull use sound design throughout cherri topsom viewer might need brief refresh wwii cold war histori film lover happi willingli lose film hour end,positive

960,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

962,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

963,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
964,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

965,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
966,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watch oppenheim great experi know mani peopl critic movi histor accuraci absenc think christoph nolan made complic man stori compel engag simpl understand actor phenomen apart main lead robert downey probabl done one finest work express time deliveri everyth par cinematographi craft beauti ador enjoy whole three hour ea delight first attempt christoph nolan biographi think expect work genr sinc entertain also spark interest know histori read book earlier went watch littl bit knowledg still enjoy film wish could tell cillian murphi person stun screen presenc throughout hope movi win award like deserv,positive
967,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christoph nolan probabl best blockbust director along ridley scott return good old fashion nocgi drama tension come word spoken peopl react chase shootout death defi stunt explos wait actual one explos dont know made scene without cgi technic achiev sureal shot mm imax beauti film lead cast season actor terrif jobmi gripe tad long final act couldshould trim still best movi seen yeari strongli recommend watch imax screen taken month,positive
968,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
969,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

972,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

973,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
974,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
975,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

976,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

977,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

979,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheim biograph thriller film written direct christoph nolan dark knight trilog incept interstellar

981,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social polit aftermath oppenheim excurs known territoryi nolan finest movi date realli know even better touch upon great ye coupl timesth great cillian murphi give one surpris lead man perform age might win oscar excel portray robert oppenheim fulli transform highli complex increasingli conflict man eye ooz tension voic point demeanour congruentth entir nd act build manhattan project lo alamo laboratori eventu deton first atom bomb best part movieoppenheim shaken stir speech triniti test arguabl engross immers moviemak summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremani poignant time jump editsth scene oppenheim presid truman oval officehair makeup depart convincingli depict oppenheim rest student year last stage livesin surprisingli typic nolan fashion end satisfi slightli fizzl rd act twist built throughout movieth great big portion movi dissapoint baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheim pretrin polit activ posttrin kangaroo trial without satisfactori reason st especi overli long rd act movi need tighter edit movi would better buildup power end movi could easili slightli modifi still pack even bigger much need gutwrench punchth movi overli den tri jampack much oppi pre posttrin life one movi nolan add plethora new charact bare rememb time jump edit sometim unnecessari hard follownot nearli enough movi actual technic feat build first atom bomb,positive

985,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poi downvot im say that way understand high rate film thousand devot nolan fan inflat score your honest there way mottl mess movi sane univers seen nolan film memento brilliant call card young director dark knight elev superhero movi someth amaz gritti crackl verisimilitud incept long slog exposit interstellar offer good moment also implod weight writerdirector egonolan like tackl big idea dream outer space delv quantum physic releg line realli oppenheim offer kitti marri explain quantum physic mostli space particl attract one anoth hold handsfor first two hour oppenheim lost blizzard short dispar scene constant music score actor chew endless dialog never allow rest never realli sure nolan offer two cryptic titl card begin fission fusion mayb way around separ time period public hear robert downey jr main charact desatur black white makeup use age deag cillian murphi oppenheim never realli know quit fit sequenti contextu storyther public hear close hear wolf pack hungri prosecutor semblanc oppenheim backstori love life gradual involv govern lead gener matt damon reason hire head lo alamo mash togeth scene never realli second long cut somewher el someth el often interpol macro shot thing fizz roil explod assum that suppos sort visual metaphor work oppenheim theoriz contempl that demonstr actual work oppenheim save one scene near begin inadvert shatter beaker class hear he terribl labyet without exagger hour movi weve told least ten time oppenheim brilliant geniu never shown nolan chief sin teller shower writer realli directortak beauti mind comparison movi director ron howard regularli visual work john nash show instanc watch pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlay view outsid young men play sport use piec white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsid schindler list spielberg movi realli observ block actor placement camera servic tell stori visual actor may domin frame mayb back turn charact may move creat entir new frame block relationship camera help tell storyin nolan filmmak camera goe realli arbitrari cut shot write actor reaction block scene edit feel clunki shot move actor start reaction come back actor alreadi motion nolan cut script reli dialog tell entir stori even play blockingtru decid tell stori father abomb chiefli two hear public one close one there go lot talk doubl talk tell even one scene casey affleck sit besid oppenheim room somewher dont even know affleck play realli short he talk oppenheim nolan cut back forth anoth scene matt damon train oppenheim damon tell u affleck wantscharact reveal action charact explain everyth sidether great mani cameo nolan film star stud rather appear name actor help clarifi charact portray distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appear focus actor previou role charactereveryth movi especi first nineti minut bounc like stone skip water scene short music never stop mani charact alway chang time place im realli sure what happen famou face keep pop dont understand everyth franticonc get halfway mark triniti project get infam test movi sink littl that nolan final slow thing let u exist somewher film moment let u immersedaft part he back whisk u one quick scene next pace tri hard breathless excit end distract frustrat still felt tune second half film could sen dilemma emot conflict oppenheim hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheim give speech toast success american empir room turn white rumbl woman skin flaysand final anoth scene emili blunt kitti oppenheim give one wolf pack prosecutor piec mind close hear realli steal show blunt truli enjoy part movi though littl screen timether much el say feel like listen hyperact child tri tell stori thought alreadi knew becam unnecessarili convolut tell didnt realli learn anyth new physic abomb realli get sen mccarthyism era oppenheim real reason could grasp close end appar reserv use hbombnolan tri twist hold back brief convers oppenheim einstein pond sever nolan film big twist one felt kind paltri twist go drove home underli grief sad whole abomb project meant world,positive

987,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

988,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan mayb one wasnt methi movi promot stori invent bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm project least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolan visual still look good movi there noth breathtak warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go that probabl true movieit also turn mostli stori polit vendetta market bomb explod littl movi whole trailer realli one scene guess wasnt interest way approach lo alamo part stori could focu scientif challeng realli best sourc storyw get review oppenheim secur clearanc lead retel histori flashback stori creat bomb told well person relationship guess communist parti member charact play pugh nake time sure necessari time get much shorter stori confirm hear strauss flashback coupl meet involv oppenheim polit drama much drama isnt enough emot connect charact care oppenheim lose secur clearanc strauss get serv karma cabinet confirm hear care your invest charact would care happen endmayb best one sourc materi mayb mistak want tell particular stori mayb better write stay away gimmick two timelin flashback intersect couldv told stori better mayb time nolan let go gimmick movi trust subject matterunlik previou nolan movi wont think movi much want watch understand better there noth el therefor isnt one top movi technic great act also great write edit isnt therealso imax great everi movi benefit one realli didnt mayb nolan wasnt focus technic side hed abl get emot invest storyed come back add compar movi much better job show tell stori real tensionth imit gamea movi geniu tri solv problem war topic scienc heavi movi goe person struggl relationship person consequ suffer polit timeth tension focus task break german code happen lead charact year later lot easier invest even though know war v result polit hear,positive
989,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day.

990,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristoph nolan oppenheim bloat overwrought ultim unsatisfi film film three hour long feel even longer thank nolan penchant unnecessari scene charact support charact flat onedimension dont enough time developth sound music also loud overus noisi illusori scene glare disturb film also visual confus nolan trademark use shaki camera quick cutsth bright spot film matt damon perform gener lesli grove damon give nuanc complex perform he enough save filmoveral oppenheim mess long confus ultim unsatisfi film nolan overr director often tell simpl stori complic overlong manner filmaddit thoughtsi also disappoint film portray atom bomb film doesnt realli explor moral implic bomb doesnt realli show devast causedi also found film end unsatisfi film end oppenheim breakdown clear he learn experienceoveral would recommend oppenheim anyon long confus ultim unsatisfi film,neutral
991,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

992,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

993,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheim technic masterpiec haunt score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act charact build arc throughout film peak arguabl best moment bomb drop pair aggress bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truli remarkablether fault incred act monument cast oppenheim murphi play oppenheim way enabl audienc feel graviti situat histor repercuss follow howev robert downey jr play lewi strauss arguabl best oppenheim cast bring downey jr perfectli portray slow spiral eventu downfal characterth film shine shift psycholog element focus oppenheim impact action effect person scene small theatr give speech success bomb easili one film haunt gutwrench momentsi wish moment like thatif film follow psycholog approach close engag level would higher make run time feel consider shorter howev third act portray oppenheim polit scapegoat done well see actor shinehowev oppenheim flaw nonlinear timelin use abundantli nolan sometim struggl fastpac switch overload charact interview heavi dialogu constant time chang time make difficult follow polit aspect stori engag level first last act low make stori feel dull sluggish state script studi immens impact event oppenheim famili psycholog level would help meander polit stori flow smoothli ye threehour run time could definit cut least minto summaris oppenheim technic masterpiec sound design soundtrack cinematographi act peak game portray polit impact creation atom bomb america world howev pace issu extend run time heavi polit agenda steer u away effect oppenheim provid problem otherwis strong film,positive
994,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

996,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months.

997,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

998,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheim rate ten plu cinema nowif movi repres last one hundr year exist planet place time capsul open year time chanc planet still exist oppenheimerthi truli astonish achiev cinema storytel cover wide arc world event person play pivot role th centuri affect u today mani still respons fear instabl around globeoppenheim written direct christoph nolan chill disturb engross movi sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portray human folli pursuit power corrupt jealousi lie spread like cancer undermin reput detest charact like hitler j edgar hoover senat joseph mccarthi mussolini mention establish timelin name dont appear oppenheim howev influenc consequ tyranni obviou examin life juliu robert oppenheim studi physic germani return america eventu recruit work manhattan projectin oppenheim appoint director manhattan project situat desert new mexico lo alamo laboratori town specif built one purpos personnel lo alamo oppenheim task develop first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programth second half oppenheim found compel inventor destruct forc ever unleash planet sidelin vilifi terribl deliber destruct bomb hiroshima nagasaki japan end one war know today noth end war volatil planetth oppenheim quot appear begin movi becom death destroy world sum suspicion guilt fear destruct two citi nagasaki hiroshima presid harri truman chose destroy glibli comment would spare kyoto beauti citi wife share wonder honeymoon event oppenheim vilifi investig communist witch hunt mani ego driven power adversari summon testifi hear prove he traitorth perform oppenheim stun cast includ cillian murphi emili blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florenc pugh ramus malek casey afffleckth four standout perform irish actor cillian murphi titl role j robert oppenheim truli oscar worthi perform impress quiet complex scientist whose problemat wife kitti play emili blunt one finest perform moment movi also earn oscar nominationth standout robert downey jr lewi strauss vindict complic associ oppenheim betray friend sake ambitionth look movi also impress especi huge screen like local gmax interestingli oppenheim first ever imax film partial shot mm black white celluloid kodak develop first ever film stock imax process order black white footag look qualiti rest moviei sum say oppenheim finest interest biographi movi ive seen cinema mani year congratul christoph nolan think greatest movi yet,neutral
999,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",think minor say think christoph nolan miss mark film let first talk work oppenheim doubt treat ear eye watch imax mm crisp detail mm film stock superb dtshd master audio surround sound impact sometim even shake seat act outstand realli memor moment ten scene actor also dont think need say anyth nolan filmmak he like martin scorses way know exactli your go get nolan film term style tonenow onto problem nolan film tend dialogueheavi film differ done earlier research oppenheim life purpos go film blank slate let nolan work felt disappoint look peopl name backstori movi nolan throw right plot without whole lot exposit background real histor figur portray normal dont like lot exposit hour long film would great could fill blank reallif figur motiv aspir get better feel either support deni help oppenheim manhattan projectmi major gripe absenc real emot arch film somewhat straightforward retel event better watch threehour documentari oppenheim work manhattan project without extens exposit mention earlier ye edit nonlinear fashion one reedit film chronolog youd get straightforward somewhat dri narr one goal filmmak help empath charact especi protagonist although nolan perhap want u feel ambival oppenheim ambigu moral still would nice get littl bit better perspect oppenheim decid move forward manhattan project beyond obviou reason want recognit premier theoret physicistthi also true moment film wish includ would left last impact audienc ad actual drop bomb hiroshima nagasaki includ mere mention radio broadcast opinion emot weight drop two bomb wit sheer horror impact total lost audienc beyond oppenheim wake nightmar throughout film film statur sometim imagin scenic moment head watch film taint experi type high expect potenti emot impact scene tri let dampen experi realiz moment includ film felt much left imaginationlastli sound design much better interstellar nolan previou film score overpow dialogu could hear dialogu oppenheim film still hand time couldnt hear peopl speak orchestr score that say hold film back substant way want mention still seem minor issu nolan filmographythi film doubt regard classic nolan pantheon like rank amongst prestig dark knight incept interstellar nolan greatest work cant help feel like nolan also bit autopilot term filmmak prowess much like p anderson licoric pizza we anderson astroid citi power filmmak found sweet spot stick nolan feel lean strength well oppenheim opinion longer challeng filmmak necessarili bad thing one best live director fan steven spielberg stanley kubrick david lynch ridley scott versatil director tackl differ genr tone feel nolan stick gun well explos keep give u intellig charact studi unfortun occasion lack catharsi heighten emot depth,positive
1000,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due. A 10 used to meant perfection, not just the glare or the sparkles. Remember not all that shines is gold.",sadden mani peopl mistak bigger louder qualiti first loud soundtrack matter good might doesnt equat qualiti film overwhelm complement filmfor past year kept hear see imax format perfect magnific visual sound effect strang pseudo documentari littl benefit enhanc film formatw percent straightforward standard present noth special pretti much talk withno memor background camera angl special framingthen big event someth last five minut underwhelm couldnt relat nuclear atom reaction need imax premium formatwhat opportun see depict pretti choppi overlap dialogu doesnoth allow u follow event movi jump variou date point view wonder need shoot color black whitew certainli deal lawrenc arabia schindler list manhattan movi allow u relish outstand cinema could give u pain glori complex life eventlet fair give someth due use meant perfect glare sparkl rememb shine gold,positive
